When generating text, an AI model calculates a probability for every possible next word. The temperature and top_p parameters are two key controls that adjust how the model chooses from these probabilities, directly influencing the creativity and predictability of its response. Temperature acts like a creativity dial by altering the probability distribution of potential words. A low temperature (e.g., 0.1) makes the model more confident and deterministic, almost always choosing the word with the highest probability. This results in focused, predictable text ideal for factual answers or summarization. A high temperature (e.g., 0.9) flattens the probabilities, increasing the chance that less likely words are chosen. This introduces randomness, leading to more diverse, creative, and sometimes surprising responses, which is useful for brainstorming or writing stories. 

Top_p, also known as nucleus sampling, controls creativity by creating a shortlist of the most probable words to choose from. It works by selecting the smallest set of words whose cumulative probability is greater than the p value. For example, a top_p of 0.8 tells the model to only consider the most likely words that add up to an 80% probability, ignoring all others. A low top_p (e.g., 0.2) creates a very small, safe set of choices, resulting in highly predictable text. A high top_p (e.g., 0.95) allows for more variety by creating a larger pool of plausible options, while still cutting off the tail end of very unlikely or bizarre words. It's often recommended to adjust either temperature or top_p, but not both at the same time, as they both influence the model's selection process in different ways.
